# DSA and Notes

> **Consistency over perfection.** — A personal repository for daily learning, DSA practice, and technical notes.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves two goals:

1. **Daily DSA Practice** — Solving data structures and algorithm problems in Java, organized by topic.
2. **Tech Notes** — Concise, beginner-friendly notes on Go, Databases, and DevOps — written in Feynman style (explain it simply).

The aim is to show up every day, learn something, and document it.

## 🚀 Running Java Files

Make sure you have [Java JDK](https://adoptium.net/) installed (Java 11+).

```bash
# Compile a file
javac dsa-java/arrays/TwoSum.java

# Run the compiled class
java -cp dsa-java/arrays TwoSum
```

Or from the repository root:

```bash
cd dsa-java/arrays
javac TwoSum.java
java TwoSum
```

## 📚 Sections Overview

### 🔢 DSA Java (`dsa-java/`)
Problems organized by topic. Each file:
- Has one problem per file with the problem name as the class name
- Includes comments explaining the approach
- Lists time and space complexity
- Provides example input/output in comments

See [`dsa-java/README.md`](dsa-java/README.md) for full details.

### 📓 Tech Notes (`notes/`)
Markdown notes organized by topic:
- **golang/** — Go language fundamentals, interfaces, and concurrency
- **databases/** — SQL basics, joins, and indexing
- **devops/** — Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines

Notes follow the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/): simple language, real-world examples, and ASCII diagrams where helpful.

## 💡 Motivation

> "You don't need to be great to start, but you need to start to be great."

This repo is about building a habit. One problem, one note, every day. Small steps compound into big results.
